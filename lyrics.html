            She's gone away
            Flying out on a jet plane
            Told me, she won't be back again
            And Talullah is her name

            Well, I got this thing, girl
            I wanted to say to you
            Talullah, I'm still missing you
            Baby, can't you stop that plane

            Turn it around, I still love you, baby
            Tell the captain I'm to blame
            There's ink stained with tears
            All these letters from my heavy heart

            This is what I always feared
            Sparks would fly and we would break apart
            Gotta stop that plane

            Turn it around
            Stop that plane
            And just turn it around

            Stop that plane
            And turn it around for me
            There's a hole in my soul
            And I'm loosing control
            And it's not to late for me to take
            This love somewhere else, baby
            Can't you see my mind

            I need you all the time
            And it's not too late for you to turn
            That plane around, come see me, baby
            She's gone away
            Flying out on a jet plane
            Told me, she won't be back again
            And Talullah is her name

            I curl up tight
            So alone, I can't sleep at night
            Return to sender, that's me tonight
            Stop that plane, turn it around

            I still love you, babe
            Tell the captain I'm to blame
            I'm to blame, I'm to blame
        </pre>
